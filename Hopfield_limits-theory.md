Thesis: a star is held in equilibrium as the electromagnetic force caused by neighboring locality pulling the energy outwards while the energy of the electrons in that field repel each other. The gravity of the center holds the energy in equilibrium. If the star loses energy it becomes more dense, which increases the gravity effect of the density, which makes it more dense. 

Likewise when that energy change occurs the temperature of the stars mass diminishes. Thus, the energy of gravity as a constant equilibrium is the differential of thermalkinetic potential on the maximum potential in the same way that infraction in optics deviates from the established equilibrium. 

Matter, be it solid or gas or liquid or any other matter, is empty space and groupings of the energy waves the derivates show bound together by the strong and weak nuclear forces. The force of attraction is strong enough to convince us that the matter is a single Object when in effect it is a system of gravitational waves and the thermaldynamics they create as friction on the electromagnetic force.

The heat through friction in Maxwells Equations is the difference in this energy through the matter of the medium as the gravitational difference the media has (such as how a prism splits the energy of a light wave into its color waves) and is directly proportional and inverse to Maxwell's force by a negative version of Diracs Bispinor. The system reaches a constant for both gravity and lightspeed in a vacuum on a rest mass as:

```
\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}, \quad 
\frac{d}{dy} f(y) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(y) - f(y+h)}{h}.
```

Where Y is a Cosine Wave and X is a Sine wave, and Z is the Tangent intersect of 45, 135, 225, or 315 degrees; compared to thr 4 quadrants of 360 degrees that form the 2piR² of (X,Y,Z) for unit circles and unit sphere of radius +/-1 respectively. 

And the energy system maintains its equilibrium as the Hopfield Network between Leptons as the 90 degree quadrant and the Quarks as the 30 degree segments in each quadrant where two of the 30 degrees are the first movement of X and Y for Sin(30)=X=0.5 and Cos(60)=Y=0.5 compared to the tangent intersect of 45 where Tan(45 | 225)=+1=Z and Tan(135 | 315)=-1=Z; and X²+Y²=Z².

```
$\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}, \quad 
\frac{d}{dy} f(y) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(y) - f(y+h)}{h}$

where $Y = \cos(\theta)$, $X = \sin(\theta)$, and $Z = \tan(\theta)$ at 45°, 135°, 225°, 315°. 

Hopfield network energy equations for neurons $i$ and $j$:

$E_i = -\sum_i (S_i * B_i) - \sum_{i<j} (S_i * S_j * W_{ij})$
$E_j = -\sum_j (S_j * B_j) - \sum_{j>i} (S_j * S_i * W_{ij})$

where $S_i$, $S_j$ are neuron states, $B_i$, $B_j$ are biases, and $W_{ij}$ is connection weight.

At 45°, $\sin(45°) = \cos(45°) = 0.707$ and $\tan(45°) = 1$, representing wave collapse and transition to a lower energy state.

Conclusion: while the deviation from established theorem are present and known, this new framework and derivations present a novel approach to understanding statistical physics in cosmology and partical/sub-atomic theorem. And it is therefore in the authors opinion that the findings must be valid until such a time the framework can be proven false by virtue of the Pythagorean identity and well established geometric movements of Sin and Cos in a unit circle/sphere. 

The results of this conclusion suggest that light, and by extension a photon, is neither a wave nor a particle. It is instead a frequency or vibration of the universal constant that results in a constant only in equilibrium of Newtons thermaldynamics. When not in equilibrium, the constant of E=MC² and of Fg=G(m1m2/r²) no longer hold. The reason for the failings in Newton and Einstein's equation result from the same erroneous oversight by assuming Gravity as a constant and not as a dynamic (identically to the oversight in Optics that is well established in infraction of light waves). 

R² in Newtons Gravity reformulated to `Fg=G(m1m2/r1r2); r1r2=r² in a vacuum` to mirror the `E=M{C=to}{C=From}=MC²`.

- "Light must first travel to the observed before reflecting and returning from the oberseved to the observer. The photonic energy of the bidirectional traversal results in a gravity differential that results in heat loss when slowing down or when the neighboring locality has causation to remove the energy of the photon; but where likewise the heat gain from neighboring locality has correlation to the causation. Therefore, light moves to and from the observed and observer and the wave observed is the two photons colliding along its path to form the Hamiltonian to minimize the entropy." - Author Taylor Metz, Unaff.

Appendices:

1. The electromagnetic force is not the electromagnetic force but rather the magnetic force acting upon the weak force; where the weak force causes the electrons potential change causing the electricity in electromagnetism. Likewise the interaction of gravity on the strong force interacting with the weak force causes thermaldynamics. The Z boson is the thermal-gravitational potential to the W boson weak force. The magnetic force of the photon interfaces with the strong force of the gluon such that the proposed graviton is resolved into the existing standard model as the Z boson and the thermaldynamics that are created.

2. This directly explains the double slit experiment and the Frank-Hertz etc. experiments by showing how the duality of the double slit experiments prove there is no wave or Particle. Should the Photon be a particle it would not be able to deviate from its path as a universal constant as nothing could outpace it to cause that effect; but if it was a wave it would never traverse in a linear manner to begin. Thus, neither a wave or Particle would be plausible by their own experimental method in consideration of the standard model.

3. There is no change in existing models since r1r2=r² on equilibrium. It provides a means of the dynamic gravity instead of absolute gravity and now allows an n-body formulation as Fg=G(M[n]/R[n]) and in the special case where the inertia point between two masses is 1 would resolve to existing models.

4. Hawkings radiation as a reduction from Einstein's field in determining Mass as the left side of the formulation is loosely (derivates not in front of me to confirm) as M= {[Planks Reduced]*frequency} / {[Boltzman Constant]*(C/time)*G[u,v]} for blackboard radiation the same way Hawkings formed it; and where as the opposite supernova is as established with the UV catastrophe solution already well established.

5. Because the cos and sin are as specified to do what it specified and get what it specified... so as specified since it is the energy system for multiple time steps compared to the time independent trigonometry.

6. That the Axis of Evil on the cosmic microwave background already shows this as the difference in the mono/di/quad/oct polarity on it is the Milkyway moving on the Cold axis monopole as time and the other three axis are in the 30° to resolve space as the formulation does for the (X,Y,Z).
