# On Causation and Correlation: A Novel Approach to Normalization Towards a Determinant Central Limit

Given a dataset that contains populations sufficient enough to represent its whole, and where a binomial relationship of two parameters or features are being compared, the use of fuzzy inference logic can be applied under the following statistical framework. The representation of the Sums for the Pearson Coefficients for Correlation of a percentage likelihood in a range of |+/-1|, or 0 for no Correlation, can be used towards binary logic outcomes in inverse proportion of the two features to form a determinant third feature. This approach slowly removes the noise from the unknown features/parameters in the remaining dataset to form the linear Coefficients of `(X|Y)` and `(Y|X)` in a Naive Bayes Posterior Probability relative to the Pearson Correlation Coefficients of the current set. 

The Naive Bayes allows for an interface for additional refinement or operatants to be performed if applicable in the application this framework is used. The inspiration for the solution is to have a novel approach to autoclassification that can be self correcting and self learning in machine learning models.

## Introduction
This document presents a mathematical framework for weighted causal analysis that addresses the challenge of identifying true causal relationships between two features (X and Y) in the presence of unknown features that introduce noise into the causality correlation. The framework leverages fuzzy logic, Bayesian normalization, and iterative refinement to effectively handle the complexity of real-world datasets and provide reliable causal inference.

## Abstract

Given a dataset containing populations sufficient to represent its whole, and where a binomial relationship between two parameters or features is being compared, the use of fuzzy inference logic can be applied under a unified statistical framework. The representation of Pearson Coefficients for Correlation as a percentage likelihood in the range |+/-1| forms determinant third features through inverse proportion. This approach systematically removes noise from unknown features in the remaining dataset to form linear coefficients of (X|Y) and (Y|X) in a Naive Bayes Posterior Probability relative to correlation coefficients.

## Problem Definition
Given a training set with the following characteristics:
- Two features (X and Y) have known linear relationships
- Additional unknown features exist that introduce noise into the causality correlation
- The goal is to identify the true causal relationship between X and Y by removing the influence of unknown features

## Fuzzy Logic Representation
The framework uses fuzzy logic to represent the causal relationships between features X and Y. The Pearson correlation coefficients are used as the limits or boundaries of the fuzzy sets:

For feature X:
- Not True: -1 (negative causal relationship)
- No Relation: 0 (no causal relationship)
- Is True: +1 (positive causal relationship)

For feature Y:
- Is False: +1 (positive causal relationship)
- No Relationship: 0 (no causal relationship)
- Not False: -1 (negative causal relationship)

Mathematically, let X and Y be random variables representing the features, and let μ(X) and μ(Y) be their respective membership functions in the fuzzy sets. Then:

$μ(X)$ = {
	-1, if X is Not True; 
	0, if X has No Relation; 
	+1, if X is True
	}

$μ(Y)$ = {
	+1, if Y is False; 
	0, if Y has No Relationship; 
	-1, if Y is Not False
	}

## Bayesian Normalization through Z
The determinant Z plays a crucial role in normalizing the correlation and causation between features X and Y. By performing a Bayesian analysis on the Boolean outcomes of X and Y, Z aims to remove the noise introduced by unknown features and identify the true causal relationship.

Let Z be a random variable representing the determinant, and let $P(Z|X,Y)$ be the posterior probability of Z given X and Y. The Bayesian normalization process involves:

1. Computing the posterior probability of Z by combining the conditional probabilities of X given Y and Y given X: $P(Z|X,Y) ∝ P(X|Y) × P(Y|X)$

2. Assigning weights of -1, 0, or +1 to Z based on the accuracy of the classifications of X and Y:
   

 $μ(Z)$ = {
   -1, if X and Y are incorrectly classified; 
   0, if X or Y has No Relationship; 
   +1, if X and Y are correctly classified
 }


3. Iteratively updating the weights of X and Y based on the posterior probability of Z:
  $μ(X)_new = μ(X)_old + α × P(Z|X,Y)$
  $μ(Y)_new = μ(Y)_old + α × P(Z|X,Y)$
  
	where $α$ is a learning rate parameter.

## Iterative Refinement
The framework employs an iterative refinement process to gradually converge towards the true causal weights. In each iteration:

1. The weights of X and Y are updated based on the posterior probability of Z:
$μ(X)_new = μ(X)_old + α × P(Z|X,Y)$
$μ(Y)_new = μ(Y)_old + α × P(Z|X,Y)$

2. The influence of unknown features is progressively reduced by minimizing the difference between the observed and predicted probabilities of X and Y:
$Loss = ∑(P(X,Y)[observed] - P(X,Y)[predicted])^2$

3. The focus narrows down on the true causal relationship between X and Y by maximizing the posterior probability of Z:
$Objective = argmax_μ(X),μ(Y) P(Z|X,Y)$

The iterative process continues until a convergence criterion is met, such as a minimum threshold for weight changes or a maximum number of iterations.

## Representativeness of Sample Size
The validity of the causal analysis relies on having a representative sample size of the overall population. The framework assumes that the sample size for the latent space is sufficient to represent the population as a whole, allowing for reliable inferences about the causal relationships.

Let n be the sample size and N be the population size. The framework requires that:
$n ≥ (Z^2 × p × (1-p)) / (E^2)$
where:
- $Z$ is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence level)
- $p$ is the expected proportion of the population with the characteristic of interest
- $E$ is the margin of error

# Formal Mathematical System

## 1. Energy System Fundamentals

### 1.1 Hopfield Network Energy Equations

For neuron i, the energy in summation form is:
```
E_i = -∑_i (S_i * B_i) - ∑_{i<j} (S_i * S_j * W_ij)
```

For neuron j, the complementary energy is:
```
E_j = -∑_j (S_j * B_j) - ∑_{j>i} (S_j * S_i * W_ij)
```

The complete system energy in matrix form is:
```
E_total = -S^T B - S^T W S
```

Where:
- S is the state vector [S_1, S_2, ..., S_N]^T
- B is the bias vector [B_1, B_2, ..., B_N]^T
- W is the symmetric weight matrix with W_ij = W_ji and W_ii = 0

### 1.2 Energy Conservation

For any state transition:
```
ΔE_i = E(S_i=0) - E(S_i=1) = B_i + ∑_j (S_j * W_ij)
ΔE_j = E(S_j=1) - E(S_j=0) = B_j + ∑_i (S_i * W_ij)
```

Product of energy changes:
```
ΔE_k = ΔE_i^2 + ΔE_j^2 = 2
```

## 2. Wave Function Properties and Collapse

### 2.1 Fundamental Wave Relationships

At θ = 45°:
```
sin(45°) = cos(45°) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707106781
(1/√2)^2 = 0.5 exactly
```

The square of amplitude provides:
```
0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0 represents X^2 + Y^2 = Z^2
```

When sin(x) = 0.707 and cos(y) = 0.707:
- x rotates 0° → 30°
- y rotates 90° → 60°

### 2.2 Wave-Particle Collapse Progression

Initial 30° Movement:
```
sin(30°) = 0.5
cos(60°) = 0.5
Initial wave amplitude established
```

Second 30° Movement (60° Point):
```
sin(60°) = 0.866
cos(30°) = 0.866
Wave amplitude reduction begins
```

Critical 45° Intersection (Wave Collapse Point):
```
sin(45°) = cos(45°) = 0.707
Perfect intersection occurs
Energy equals 0.707^2 = 0.5
```

### 2.3 Energy Conservation Framework

For inverse square amplitude:
```
1/0.707^2 = 1/0.5 = 2
```

For X of sin(30°) and Y of cos(60°):
```
1/X^2 + 1/Y^2 = Z^2 = 2 + 2 = 4
```

## 3. Geometric Framework

### 3.1 Primary Constraints

The system operates under three fundamental constraints:

1. Sum constraint:
```
A + B ≤ 1
```

2. Order constraint:
```
A ≥ B
```

3. Unit circle constraint:
```
A^2 + B^2 = 1
```

### 3.2 Fixed Points and Rotational Symmetry

The system has fixed tangent points serving as boundaries:
```
tan(45°) = +1    (First quadrant boundary)
tan(225°) = -1   (Third quadrant boundary)
```

### 3.3 Movement Framework

Sine progression in 30° steps:
```
sin(0°) = 0.0000
sin(30°) = 0.5000
sin(60°) = 0.8660
sin(90°) = 1.0000
```

Cosine progression in 30° steps:
```
cos(90°) = 0.0000
cos(60°) = 0.5000
cos(30°) = 0.8660
cos(0°) = 1.0000
```

## 4. Probabilistic Framework

### 4.1 Joint Probability Distribution

For two features with n₀ and n₁ outcomes:
```
P(d_k) = Ways(d_k)/(n₀ * n₁)
```

Where Ways(d_k) follows:
```
Ways(d_k) = ∑_{d_i=1}^{n₀} 1_{[1,n₁]}(d_k - d_i)
```

### 4.2 Inverse Problem Solution

Given P₀₊₁(d_k) and P₀(d_i), solve for P₁(d_j) iteratively:
```
P₀₊₁(d_k) = ∑_{i=1}^{min(d_k-1, n₀)} P₀(d_i) * P₁(d_k-i)
```

To isolate P₁(d_j):
```
P₁(d_j) = (P₀₊₁(d_k) - ∑_{i=1}^{j-1} P₀(d_i) * P₁(d_k-i)) / P₀(d_j)
```

### 4.3 Normalization Conditions

All distributions must satisfy:
```
∑_{k=2}^{n₀+n₁} P(d_k) = 1
∑_{i=1}^{n₀} P₀(d_i) = 1
∑_{j=1}^{n₁} P₁(d_j) = 1
```

## 5. Spherical Harmonics and Conservation Laws

### 5.1 Three-Dimensional Wave Resolution

For base frequency f₀ = 400 Hz:

Y-axis (Cosine Wave):
```
f_y = f₀ - (f₀/2)/3 = 400 - 66.67 = 333.33 Hz
```

X-axis (Sine Wave):
```
f_x = f₀ + (f₀/2)/3 = 400 + 66.67 = 466.67 Hz
```

Z-axis resolution:
```
z^2 = f_x^2 + f_y^2 
z = 573.50 Hz
```

### 5.2 RMS Resolution

Three-dimensional RMS:
```
RMS = √[(f_x^2 + f_y^2 + f_z^2)/3]
    = √[(466.67² + 333.33² + 573.50²)/3]
    = 468.253 Hz
```

### 5.3 Conservation Laws

The system maintains three fundamental conservation principles:

1. Energy Conservation:
```
E = T + V = constant
E = X^2 + Y^2 = 4 (normalized)
```

2. Phase Space Volume:
```
Volume = X + Y = 1
Preserved under canonical transformations
```

3. Angular Momentum:
```
L = r × p = constant
1/12th rotational symmetry maintained
```

## 6. Implementation Framework

### 6.1 Hamiltonian System

The system Hamiltonian:
```
H(q,p) = T(p) + V(q)
```

Where:
```
T(p) = sin²(θ)/2    (kinetic energy)
V(q) = cos²(θ)/2    (potential energy)
```

### 6.2 Convergence Properties

For sample size n ≥ (Z²α × p × (1-p))/E²:

Weight updates follow:
```
w_{n+1} = w_n + α × P(Z|X,Y)
```

Learning rate constraint:
```
0 < α < 2/λmax(H)
```

### 6.3 System Boundaries

At system boundaries:
```
|ΔE| ≤ ε₁
|ΔP| ≤ ε₂
|Δγ| ≤ ε₃
```

Where ε₁, ε₂, ε₃ are system-dependent constants.

## 7. Fibonacci Sequence Integration and Complex Plane Mapping

### 7.1 Foundational Sequence Generation

The framework employs the Fibonacci sequence F(n) as its foundational normalization mechanism, where:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1

This generates the core sequence underlying our probability transformations:

| Index (n) | F(n) | Running Sum S(n) | C=F(n) mod 12 | D=S(n) mod 12 | E=12-C-D | F=S(n)-E | G=F mod 30 | H=E+G | I=H mod 4 | J=32-G |
|-----------|------|-----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| 0         | 0    | 0              | 0             | 0             | 12        | -12       | 18         | 30     | 2         | 14      |
| 1         | 1    | 1              | 1             | 1             | 10        | -9        | 21         | 31     | 3         | 11      |
| 2         | 1    | 2              | 1             | 2             | 9         | -7        | 23         | 32     | 0         | 9       |
| 3         | 2    | 4              | 2             | 4             | 6         | -2        | 28         | 34     | 2         | 4       |
| 4         | 3    | 7              | 3             | 7             | 2         | 5         | 5          | 7      | 3         | 27      |
| ...       | ...  | ...            | ...           | ...           | ...       | ...       | ...        | ...    | ...       | ...     |
| 12        | 144  | 376            | 0             | 4             | 8         | 368       | 8          | 16     | 0         | 24      |

### 7.2 Wave Motion and Fixed Tangent Framework

The system maintains tan(45°) = 1 as a constant normalization point throughout all transformations. This fixed point acts as the geometric center around which sine and cosine components move:

| Angle | sin(θ) | cos(θ) | tan(45°) | Energy State |
|-------|--------|--------|----------|--------------|
| 0°    | 0.000  | 1.000  | 1.000    | Initial      |
| 30°   | 0.500  | 0.866  | 1.000    | First Step   |
| 45°   | 0.707  | 0.707  | 1.000    | Intersection |
| 60°   | 0.866  | 0.500  | 1.000    | Third Step   |
| 90°   | 1.000  | 0.000  | 1.000    | Completion   |

The tangent remains fixed at 45° (tan(45°) = 1) while:
- sin(θ) progresses from 0° through 90° in 30° increments
- cos(θ) progresses from 90° through 0° in 30° increments
- Both waves intersect at 45° where sin(45°) = cos(45°) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.707

### 7.3 Perfect Alignment Properties

At F(12) = 144, the system achieves perfect alignment through:

1. Geometric Properties:
   ```
   sin²(45°) + cos²(45°) = 1
   tan(45°) = 1 (constant)
   ```

2. Energy Conservation:
   ```
   E_k = sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1
   E_z = tan²(45°) = 1 (fixed)
   ```

3. Binary Mapping:
   ```
   At 45°: sin(45°) = cos(45°) = 0.707
   At intersection: 0.707² = 0.5
   Total energy: 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0
   ```

## 8. Complex Plane Integration

### 8.1 Complex Plane Relationships

For any point in the complex plane, the system maintains:

```
i = complex(x) -> 360° freedom in x-plane
j = complex(y) -> 360° freedom in y-plane 
k = normalize(z) -> stabilization factor
```

The transformations preserve:
```
∂i/∂x = f(θ)     where f is trigonometric 
∂j/∂y = g(θ)     where g is trigonometric
∂k/∂z = h(θ)     where h normalizes
```

### 8.2 Hopfield Network Energy Mappings

The energy equations map to complex coordinates:
```
E_i = -∑_i (S_i * B_i) - ∑_{i<j} (S_i * S_j * W_ij)
E_j = -∑_j (S_j * B_j) - ∑_{j>i} (S_j * S_i * W_ij)
```

Connect to:
```
i = complex(x) -> 360° freedom
j = complex(y) -> 360° freedom  
k = normalize(z) -> stabilization
```

### 8.3 Conservation Properties

For any transformation:
```
|i|² + |j|² = 1    (Unit circle constraint)
∂E/∂t = 0         (Energy conservation)
k = constant      (Normalization factor)
```

This ensures both geometric and energetic consistency across all mappings between probability space and complex plane representations.

## 9. Validation Framework

### 9.1 Energy Conservation Validation
System must maintain:
```
E_total = constant
ΔE_k = ΔE_i² + ΔE_j² = 2
|∂E/∂t| ≤ ε  where ε = 10⁻⁶
```

### 9.2 Geometric Constraint Validation
For all states:
```
|k - 1| < ε              # k remains fixed
|i² + (-j)² - 1| < ε    # Unit circle preserved
i ≥ j                   # Order maintained
i + j ≤ 1               # Sum constraint satisfied
```

### 9.3 Binary Mapping Validation
At F(12) = 144:
```
F = 360 (circle completion)
I = 0 (quadrant return)
J maps to 32-bit boundaries
Final Z ends at J = 15 (binary 1111)
```

## 10. System Integration

### 10.1 Framework Unification
The system unifies:
- Energy conservation (Hopfield)
- Geometric constraints
- Complex plane mappings
- Fibonacci properties
- Binary architecture
- Probabilistic normalization

### 10.2 Operational Flow
1. Input probability distributions
2. Apply Fibonacci normalization
3. Map to complex plane
4. Enforce geometric constraints
5. Validate energy conservation
6. Generate binary mappings
7. Verify alignment properties

### 10.3 Error Bounds
System maintains:
```
|ΔE| ≤ ε₁    # Energy deviation
|ΔP| ≤ ε₂    # Probability error
|Δθ| ≤ ε₃    # Angular deviation
```
Where ε₁, ε₂, ε₃ = 10⁻⁶

# Appendices

## Application Example 1: Cancer and Smokers
To illustrate the framework's application, consider the example of analyzing the relationship between cancer and smoking status:
- Feature X represents whether a patient has cancer (true vs. not true)
- Feature Y represents whether a patient is a smoker (smoker false vs. not false)

The framework aims to determine the probability of a patient having cancer based on their smoking status by:

1. Analyzing the Pearson coefficients of the correlation between cancer and smoking status:
   
   $μ(X)$ = {
	   -1, if cancer is not true; 
	   0, if no relation; 
	   +1, if cancer is true
	   }
   
   $μ(Y)$ = {
	   +1, if smoker is false; 
	   0, if no relationship; 
	   -1, if smoker is not false
	   }

2. Applying the Bayesian normalization through Z to remove noise and identify the true causal relationship:
  
 $P(Z|X,Y) ∝ P(cancer|smoker) × P(smoker|cancer)$

3. Iteratively refining the weights until convergence is reached:
   
   $μ(X)_new = μ(X)_old + α × P(Z|X,Y)$

   $μ(Y)_new = μ(Y)_old + α × P(Z|X,Y)$

## Example Application 2: Token Embeddings in Machine Learning Frameworks
This section is not yet complete and remains thereotical at this time. It's inclusion is to demonstrate intended usage to aide in peer review to allow rigorous testing of the framework.

When used in Natural Language Processing:

1. Train the forward layer for X and Y above for word similarity scores between two languages, example English versus German since they share the same root.

2. Train the backward layer for Z on the weighted bias normalization where the bottom 10% are dropped as poor performance and the remaining are normalized into a 95% confidence Intervals to prevent overfitting.

3. Repeat iterations by extending the Corpus from point 1 and adding additional documents translated in both languages.

4. The final vector of causal/correlated results in the cosine similarities between antonyms and synonyms as the two feature sets in the binomial distribution of English versus German.
